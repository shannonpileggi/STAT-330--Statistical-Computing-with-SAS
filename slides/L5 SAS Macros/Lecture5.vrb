\ft{\%DO loop}
\bi
\item The \verb|%DO ... %TO| statement allows you to perform loops inside a macro. \\
\item \ttt{\%DO} loops in macros have the same kind of structure as standard \ttt{DO} loops in regular SAS code.\\
\item As with the conditional logic statements in macros \textbf{[}i.e. \verb|%IF ... %THEN|\textbf{]}, these statements \textbf{must} be embedded within a macro module -- they \textbf{cannot}  be placed outside of a macro module and in ``open SAS code''.\\
